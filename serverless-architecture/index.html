            <p>If you are reading this post in July 2016 (<em>when the post was written</em>), you will probably agree serverless architecture is <strong>H.O.T</strong> right now.</p>

<p>Although the concept has been well used for quite sometime, we now have an alias and title associated. So as a result we have a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Serverless-London/">meetup</a> we can now go to, a <a href="http://serverlessconf.io/">conference</a> where we can be preached to and of course this all leads to the proverbial <a href="https://twitter.com/search?h=serverless">bandwagon</a> to jump on. - This is where we are right now, so lets ask the question <mark><a href="#what">What</a> really is Serverless Architecture and <a href="#how">how</a> and <a href="#when">when</a> should we use it.</mark></p>

<h3 id="what">What</h3>

<p>To begin with the name serverless can be a little misleading.  But in short, it's typically a small application or unit of work that itself and its dependencies run on server's that you don't manage or concern yourself about.</p>

<p>But what's new about that right? Prior to the recent #devops movement, developers never really concerned themselves about consistency, availability and partition tolerance anyway.</p>

<p>But serverless takes it to the next level in the form of <a href="">BAAS</a> and <a href="#faas">FAAS</a> where there is absolute no consideration to scaling and availability. Your cloud provider takes care of this with a typical 4x9 uptime SLA.</p>

<p>But for a better definition and insight to this, <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html">Martin Fowler and thoughtworks</a> will give you greater detail than I will. - And it really is comprehensive. This in itself suggests the relevance of serverless and its expected impact in future software solutions.</p>

<h3 id="how">How</h3>

<h4 id="faas">FAAS</h4>

<p><strong>Functions as a service</strong> is quite simply a method of executing code, or a unit of work, as a service.</p>

<p>Serverless can often be better known as FAAS.  Demonstration by the tweet below; it's certainly a common opinion.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Can we please rename <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/serverless?src=hash">#serverless</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/faas?src=hash">#faas</a>? Functions as a Service. The term "Serverless" is a misnomer. It's also vendor lock-in.</p>— marak (@marak) <a href="https://twitter.com/marak/status/736357543598002176">May 28, 2016</a></blockquote>  

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>  

<p><br> <br>
I for one first started seeing the term used more often when last year AWS released <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">API gateway</a>, a managed service that alongside Lambda, offers "serverless" APIs.</p>

<p>The benefits are obvious, just as <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/overview/what-is-paas/">PAAS</a> has brought cost effective benefits, FAAS gives you a similar model. You pay for how much you use.</p>

<h4 id="baas">BAAS</h4>

<p><strong>Backend as a service</strong> is a simlar approach to FAAS but at a larger scale and covers more domains.  A classic example is using authentication as a service. <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> for example packages all the complexities involved as a oAuth provider; token persistence, user management, token serialisation and offers it as and when you need it.</p>

<p>I've come accross many custom implementations of oAuth, open Id and identity providers and all have their own faults. - Due to the complex nature of the topic. - Its a perfect candidate to offload to an expert.</p>

<p>But there are many more use cases. Consider the regulations you have to oblige to when implementing payment providers or simply taking your end users personal details.</p>

<p>This isn't just a solution for lazy software developers, this is a smart product decision to offload business value to an expert.</p>

<h3 id="when">When</h3>

<p>The problem I have with this architecture, whether we are using AWS Lambdas or Azure functions, blob storage or an S3 Bucket. We are building software driven by a chosen cloud provider.</p>

<p>My concern with building software <em>cloud first</em> and tying your product to a 3rd party, is less about availability and more about losing control.</p>

<p>AWS for example sets the minimum supported node runtime for lambdas, what happends when they decide to increase it? All of a sudden your application needs a rewrite.</p>

<p>Although cloud provider costs are compelling now, what happens if this changes and your tied to a given cloud platform? It quickly becomes unsustainable.</p>

<p>However, serverless and the adoption of the cloud offers excellent value and current pricing tiers for serverless features/products, allow us to build enterprise solutions on startup budgets.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... enterprise solutions on a startup budget</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are some considerations not to overlook when choosing to adopt serverless architecture. We're currently using it quite successfully but as always there are tradeoffs to consider.  I hope blog a followup, detailing the tradeoffs and disadvantages I have experiences.</p>
